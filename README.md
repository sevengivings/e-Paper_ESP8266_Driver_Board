ESPHome YAML example for Waveshare e-Paper ESP8266 Driver Board

To monitor indoor and outdoor ultra fine dust status and indoor CO2 level, I utilized a spare e-Paper HAT for Raspberry Pi(https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT_Manual#Introduction).

Waveshare e-Paper ESP8266 Driver Board is useful of various usages, due to ESP8266 it can be anything especially in the field of IoT(https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/E-Paper_ESP8266_Driver_Board).  

Home Assistant gets external ultra-fine dust value from Naver weather information installed through HACS, and DIY board which has the fine dust sensor (SDS021) and carbon dioxide sensor (MH-Z19B) is connected to Home Assistant through ESPHome.

I added more information and 3D printed front case(lcdcase_v2.py was generated by ChatGPT and can be opened by OpenSCAD to generate .slt 3d printing file).

If you have plan to use 7.5inch e-Paper, you should know that ESP8266 version of e-Paper driver board doesn't have enough memory. So, please buy e-Paper ESP32 driver board instead.

I attached esp32-eink75.yaml for 7.5inch E-Paper (B) E-Ink Raw Display, 800x480, Red/Black/White SPI without PCB.
